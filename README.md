# sidefox

Some simple css to seamlessly integrate [tree style tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) into firefox. 
These tweaks were inspired by [flyingfox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox) which sadly is no longer active.

- Hides firefox's tab row
- Converts window controls into macos style circles and moves them into the navbar
- Hides tree style tab sidebar header
- Collapses sidebar to only show tab icons and expand on hover
- Makes tree style tab spacing more consistent
